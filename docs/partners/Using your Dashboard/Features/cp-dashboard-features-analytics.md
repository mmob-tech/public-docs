# Analytics
-----------------

Now you have gained access to your dashboard, you can explore the following features, which allow you to access the different functions and track performance.

### Logging In

On logging into your dashboard, you will first land on the Analytics tab.

The main features are broken down as follows:

#### 1\. Filter by Category

If your organisation has enabled multiple Categories (e.g. Broadband, Credit Cards, Current Accounts), you can filter the analytics down to the category level for individual analysis. All you need to do is type the desired category you want to inspect into the search bar.

#### 2\. Select Date Range

This feature allows you to break down the analysis into custom time periods. Using the tool, you can see the performance for custom time periods.

You can default to standard time periods by clicking the blue tabs at the bottom of the date picker.

#### 3\. Customers and Orders Summary

This line graph updates with the latest customers and orders information synchronously (i.e. as it happens). For a clarification of each metric, be sure to check out the tooltip on each tab.

#### 4\. Download CSV

This feature allows you to download order and customer data in CSV format. The CSV itself contains User data and event data information useful for reconciliation or analysis at the broad level. Clicking the button will send a CSV to your downloads, and can be opened using most spreadsheet analysis tools such as Excel or Google Sheets.

Tip: to filter down on the parameters you want to set on the data, change the date range and category filters

#### 5\. View Orders

Clicking this button will take you to the ‘View Orders’ tab which is expanded on below.

#### 6\. User Funnel

The funnel shows your users' progression through the journeys you have initiated. Tooltips give an explanation of each funnel ‘bucket’.
