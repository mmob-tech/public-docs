There are two types of user which fall within the scope of a ‘Customer’:

*   Generic User - This a user which can be uniquely identified using email, which is shown above.
    
*   Anonymous User - This is a user for which the system **cannot** assign a unique identifier. In which case, the user line item will display with a random string of words:

#### Customer Profile

Clicking on the Customer line-item will then open the **Customer Profile** tab.

This allows you to see the user details associated with the user in question, as well as information about how and when they they visited your integration.

It’s important to note that the information contained on the profile will not include any subsequent data the user enters on a given service provider journey. For example, if a credit card sign up journey asks for a national insurance number and the user enters it, this will not be available to you as a CP admin user.

#### Timeline

The timeline tab contains all of the user behaviour events available. There are two classes of events, including:

*   User behaviour, measuring different interaction points that a user hits within a given journey
    
*   Funnel Events - These include events where users start journeys, view products make a purchase
